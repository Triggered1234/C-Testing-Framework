# C-Testing-Framework

A framework able to identify C source code, from a given folder structure,
compile it and run it. The resulting executables will be saved in a Output folder, in the same folder with the source codes.
The Framework will also test the execution correctness of the resulting programs by checking the exit code and the output against existing check files.
